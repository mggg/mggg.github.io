The MGGG Redistricting Lab is a non-profit research organization based at Tufts University studying
applications of geometry and computing to U.S. redistricting. Our mission is both technical
and civic, and we aim to drive cutting-edge research, amplify the voices of the public and the civil
rights community, and improve accountability in the redistricting process.

As of January 2023, we have filled our Senior Web Developer position. We anticipate more developer and researcher positions in the coming year, so please reach out to [jobs@mggg.org](mailto:jobs@mggg.org) to inquire.

This semester we seek to hire 1-2 postdoctoral scholars with experience in mathematics, computing, statistics, geography, politics, and/or law.  The positions are for 1 year, with possibility of renewal to 3 years. For more information, contact us at [jobs@mggg.org](mailto:jobs@mggg.org).
 
Access to voting rights for communities of color and other marginalized groups
is central to our mission, and we strive to build a team that is diverse in as
many ways as possible.
