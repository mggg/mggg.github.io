  **Redistricting and gerrymandering**: Redistricting is the process of drawing new legislative boundaries, usually in order to balance the population across districts. Map makers have a lot of latitude, and how they draw the lines can impact the outcome of the elections. When they draw lines to benefit one group over another, we call this gerrymandering.

  Our book [Political Geometry](/gerrybook) includes a ton of information about redistricting and gerrymandering. Here are a few chapters to get started with:
  - [Chapter 0](/publications/political-geometry/00-Duchin.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} by Moon Duchin covers the rules and constraints that govern redistricting, and explains what gerrymandering is.
  - [Chapter 8](/publications/political-geometry/08-Steingart.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} by Alma Steingart looks at how computers entered the redistricting scene in the 1960s.
  - [Chapter 16](/publications/political-geometry/16-BeckerSolomon.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} by Amariah Becker and Justin Solomon explains some of the most common redistricting algorithms, i.e. processes for generating maps computationally.

  You can also check out [this article](https://theconversation.com/rebooting-the-mathematics-behind-gerrymandering-73096) by Moon Duchin and Peter Levine in The Conversation about math and gerrymandering. [This article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/geometry-versus-gerrymandering/) by Moon Duchin in Scientific American is also a great first look at how geometry and gerrymandering intersect.
