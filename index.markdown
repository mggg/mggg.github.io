# Our Mission

The **MGGG Redistricting Lab** is a research group at the [Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, led by PI Moon Duchin, that grew out of an informal research collective called the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group.   From 2018-2024, the Lab was based in the [Tisch College of Civic Life](https://tischcollege.tufts.edu/) at Tufts University, where we maintain an affiliation.  Together with our close collaborators, we have expertise and interests spanning mathematics (geometry, topology, discrete math, dynamics), algorithms, software development, geography, science studies, law, and policy. We research data science interventions – better mechanisms, better models, better metrics – for democracy.

Our goals are these:

- to pursue cutting-edge **research** in the basic science and practically
  relevant applications of geometry, topology, and computing to the design of democratic mechanisms, including but not limited to redistricting and ranked choice voting;
- to build open-source **tools and resources** that create public access and
  analytical power for better understanding election systems and their consequences;
- to partner with **civil rights** organizations to reexamine and strengthen the
  quantitative toolkit for protecting voting rights;
- to offer formal and informal expert **consulting** to stakeholders on all
  sides.
