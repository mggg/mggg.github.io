# Our Work

How do we measure fairness in representation? What makes an electoral system work for a community?

The Data and Democracy Lab approaches these as research questions and practical challenges. We develop computational methods to understand how electoral systems function, build tools that make those methods accessible, and work directly with communities, advocates, and courts to strengthen democracy.

Here you'll find:

**Basics:** Explanations of core concepts in gerrymandering, polarized voting, computational social choice, and alternative systems of election.

**Research:** Peer-reviewed publications and ongoing projects advancing the computational science of fair representation.

**Reports:** Analyses and white papers our team has prepared for courts, communities, and policymakers addressing specific redistricting plans, voting rights questions, and electoral reforms.

**Civic Tech:** Open-source tools, datasets, and interactive resources that democratize access to computational methods.
