# About Us

The **MGGG Redistricting Lab** is a research group at Tisch College of Tufts University that grew out of an informal research collective called the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group.  The Lab is led by PI Moon Duchin.  Our staff has expertise and interests spanning mathematics (geometry, topology, discrete math, dynamics), algorithms, software development, geography, [STS](https://as.tufts.edu/sts/), and policy. We research data science interventions for civil rights.

Right after the 2020 Census release, we put research effort into privacy protection in the Census, collection and aggregation of community maps, precinct collection, and tool development for commissions and litigation efforts.

Currently, our major research directions are
* algorithmic approaches to electoral redistricting;
* voting polarization and the Voting Rights Act; and
* ranked choice voting.
