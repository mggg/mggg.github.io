  **Can we build metrics of electoral fairness?** While most people agree that things like proportionality and competitiveness are important democratic ideals, we rarely agree on how to measure these things.

  Here are some resources on building metrics of electoral fairness.
  - [Chapter 2](/publications/political-geometry/02-BernsteinWalch.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} of [Political Geometry](/gerrybook) by Mira Bernstein and Olivia Walch explores different ways to measure how fair maps are with respect to parties.
  - [Chapter 3](/publications/political-geometry/03-Editors.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} by Moon Duchin and Olivia Walch discusses how fairness is (or isn't) baked into the design of U.S. democracy by interviewing four political thinkers.
