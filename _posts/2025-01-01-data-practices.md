With years of experience in electoral and demographic data, explore how the Lab answers questions about the best ways to use the data we have.

## Reports

- [Disaggregation of Unsorted Votes:](/publications/Disagg.pdf) Some modes of voting, including absentee and early voting, are only reported at
the county level. We call these votes unsorted as they have not been sorted into respective precincts. In this report we compare several different methods
for county-to-precinct vote disaggregation and discuss various methodological considerations for practitioners.
- [Conventions for Constructing Demographic Categories:](https://mggg.org/vap-cvap) In this note we explain the construction of VAP and CVAP from Census variables, using both
the ACS and the Decennial (PL 94-171) as sources.
