The 2020 Decennial Census will be released with a new disclosure avoidance system in place, putting 
differential privacy in the spotlight for a wide range of data users.  We consider several key 
applications of Census data in redistricting, developing tools and demonstrations for practitioners 
who are concerned about the impacts of this new noising algorithm called **TopDown**.  Based on a close 
look at reconstructed Texas data, we find reassuring evidence that **TopDown** will not threaten the 
ability to produce districts with tolerable population balance or to detect signals of racial 
polarization for Voting Rights Act enforcement.
