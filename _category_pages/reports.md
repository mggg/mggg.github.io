Not all of our work is for academic audiences; we also collaborate with practitioners to analyze the electoral systems that affect their lives. 

Here you'll find the body of work the Lab has produced for courts, community groups, legislatures, and nonprofit organizations as they work on the hard practical problems of maintaining healthy democracy.

We work hard to make our technical work maximally accessible.  Let us know how we did!

What you'll find here:
- **Election System Case Studies:** Deep dives into the consequences of changing the electoral system in specific jurisdictions, commissioned by cities and advocacy groups exploring electoral alternatives.
- **Redistricting Reports:** How the Lab has used the power of computational redistricting to analyze enacted, proposed, and challenged legislative maps.
- **Data Practices:** With years of experience in electoral and demographic data, explore how the Lab answers questions about the best ways to use the data we have.
