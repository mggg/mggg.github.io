description: MAUP is the geospatial toolkit for redistricting data. The package streamlines the basic workflows that arise when working with blocks, precincts, and districts, such as assigning precincts to districts, aggregating block data to precincts, disaggregating data from precincts down to blocks, prorating data when units do not nest neatly, and fixing topological issues, overlaps, and gaps.
