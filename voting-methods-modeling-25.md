# Voting Methods Modeling Workshop June 18-20, 2025

The Data and Democracy Lab (also known as MGGG Redistricting Lab) will hold an in-person workshop at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY from June 18-20, 2025. This two-and-a-half day workshop (noon Wednesday to 4pm Friday) will focus on the modeling of ranked-choice voting (RCV) and other "alternative" systems of election. 

Topics include:
- Basics of voter behavior models from the modeling literature, including those developed in our lab;
- How to use VoteKitâ€”our Python package for modeling elections;
- Place-specific study exercise that walks through how you might help local groups predict how a transition in the voting system might be expected to play out; and
- Brainstorming as a group about the next round of ideas for statistical modeling.

While comfort with Python would be helpful, the VoteKit training will be absolutely accessible to Python beginners who are willing to give it a try. Attendees are highly welcome to make feature requests for the future.
