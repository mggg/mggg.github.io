Redistricting is the process of drawing new legislative boundaries, usually in order to balance the population across districts. 
Map makers have a lot of latitude, and how they draw the lines can impact the outcome of the elections.
When they draw lines to benefit one group over another, we call this gerrymandering.

Our book [Political Geometry](/gerrybook) includes a ton of information about redistricting and gerrymandering. Here are a few chapters to get started with:
- [Chapter 0](/publications/political-geometry/00-Duchin.pdf) covers the rules and constraints that govern redistricting, and explains what gerrymandering is.
- [Chapter 8](/publications/political-geometry/08-Steingart.pdf) looks at how computers entered the redistricting scene in the 1960s.
- [Chapter 16](/publications/political-geometry/16-BeckerSolomon.pdf) explains some of the most common redistricting algorithms, i.e. processes for generating maps computationally.
