Deep dives into the consequences of changing the electoral system in specific jurisdictions, commissioned by cities and advocacy groups exploring electoral alternatives.

## Reports


- [2024 STV City Council Election in Portland, Oregon:](/portland-stv-24) Together with local partners, the Lab examined how the switch to a 12 person council elected by STV impacted the ability of people of color to elect candidates of choice. Broadly, we found that people of color were able to elect a candidate of choice in each of Portland's four districts.
- [Analysis of County Commission Elections in Yakima County, WA:](/publications/Yakima.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} We consider several possible remedies for the exclusion of candidates of choice
for minority voters in Yakima's county commission, including several ways to draw majority-minority districts in a 3-district system. We find that ranked choice voting, rather than the
use of majority-minority districts, is likely to provide the most effective and long-lasting
opportunity for Hispanic and Native voters to elect their candidates of choice. 
- [Modeling the Fair Representation Act:](/fra) The Fair Representation Act (FRA) proposes a fundamental change to the traditional electoral system
used to vote members into the United States House of Representatives. Using a combination of multimember districts and ranked-choice voting, the FRA has been claimed by advocates to promote fair
electoral outcomes. Here, we investigate the potential effects of the FRA. We find
robust evidence that the FRA promotes far more proportional outcomes for underrepresented racial
and ethnic groups, without the need for race-conscious line-drawing.
- [Comparing Electoral Systems for the Massachusetts Legislature:](/ma_legislature) In partnership with New America, we studied the possible implications of systems change in the way the Massachusetts legislature is elected.
We have applied a suite of statistical models to test alternative electoral systems, with a particular focus on STV — multi-member districts using ranked choice voting.
Our results are extremely encouraging in terms of the tendency for STV to produce proportional outcomes for Massachusetts voters. One striking finding is that STV (the multi-member form of ranked choice) would behave very differently from IRV (ranked choice where one candidate is elected per district), even if voter preferences are kept exactly constant.
- [Election Reform in Lowell, MA:](/lowell) The City of Lowell was sued in 2017 because its system of election was said to prevent minority communities from being represented in city government. The Lab studied the proposed alternatives, and found broadly that either a full RCV system, or one that also includes some at-large plurality seats, would improve representation for people of color in Lowell’s City Council.
- [Study of Reform Proposals for Chicago City Council:](/chicago) Many observers agree that the Chicago City Council ward system suffers from problems of gerrymandering, intense segregation, vestiges of machine politics, and inefficiency. We apply mathematical models to analyze Chicago’s current ward plan and compare several reform proposals to address its problems. Our findings strongly support a transition to multimember wards with ranked choice voting to secure and sustain fair representation.
- [Study of voting systems for Santa Clara, CA:](/publications/SantaClara.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} We analyze geography, demographics, and voting patterns in Santa Clara, CA in order to compare the likely performance of various systems of electing members of the City Council. We find that either citywide at-large transferable voting or a custom transferable
voting plan as the best remedy for the alleged CVRA violations in Santa Clara City Council elections.
