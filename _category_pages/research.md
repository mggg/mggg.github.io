How do we measure fairness in representation? What makes an electoral system work for a community? The Data & Democracy Lab tackles these questions through computational research at the intersection of mathematics, political science, statistics, and law.


Our Lab combines theoretical innovation with practical application to supply courts and researchers with a baseline for “neutral” redistricting, develop new frameworks to model voter preferences, and advise communities exploring electoral reform.

Key areas of our research include:

<!-- - **Democracy Design:** Analyzing how different voting methods affect representation and studying alternatives to plurality voting.
- **Developing Methods and Metrics:** Measuring aspects of representation and evaluating the fairness of maps and electoral structures. -->
