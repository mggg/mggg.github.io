This was a high-profile Voting Rights Act case arguing that Black voters in Alabama had their votes impermissibly diluted by the State's districting plan.  Black voters make up about 2/7 of Alabamians and vote quite cohesively, but the challenged plan was drawn to ensure that only 1 out of 7 districts would offer an opportunity to elect a candidate of choice.  This report mainly offers an existence proof:  it is possible to draw a reasonably configured plan with two majority-Black districts.  (In VRA law, majority-minority districts are not necessary at the end of the day, but you have to show that they are possible.)  In fact, four different possibilities are presented -- Plans A,B,C, and D -- and they balance traditional districting principles in a variety of ways.
