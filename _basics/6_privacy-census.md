  **Privacy and the census**: In order to protect the privacy of individual Census respondents, Census data is released only at aggregate levels, typically combining records for hundreds of individuals or more and just reporting the overall counts. Unfortunately, on its own, this does not provide enough protection to prevent privacy attacks.

  To handle this privacy threat, the 2020 Decennial Census was released with a new disclosure avoidance system in place.
