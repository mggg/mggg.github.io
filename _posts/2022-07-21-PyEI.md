In a given election, did members of various racial/ethnic groups have systematically different preferences than others?  This is called “racially polarized voting” (or RPV), and assessing it is a key element in ascertaining the fairness of electoral systems to minority groups.  Under the current Voting Rights Act, a system may violate the law if sizeable minority groups have distinct preferences that are consistently thwarted.  But we have a secret ballot!  You don’t mark your name, and you certainly don’t mark your race, when you cast your vote. This means that we have to apply statistical inference methods to “learn” patterns of voting by race.  

Taking data that is aggregated one way (vote totals by precinct) and guessing how to aggregate it a different way (vote share by race) is called 
the *Ecological Inference Problem*, and it’s a thorny problem with lots of known 
[paradoxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox#UC_Berkeley_gender_bias).  But nevertheless we can try to use sound methods and stay 
mindful of our confidence and uncertainty.

The simplest reasonable thing you could do is just look for patterns in the precinct-level results:  
if the precincts with the most Black voters tend to have the strongest vote share for Candidate A, then probably Black voters prefer A overall.  Fitting a simple line to this pattern is called Ecological Regression, or ER.  But for the last few decades, the most widely used family of methods 
for RPV is called Ecological Inference, or EI.  The most sophisticated version that’s in wide use is a hierarchical Bayesian model that tries to fit 
a probability distribution to every precinct that models how members of each group might vote.

The MGGG Redistricting Lab has recently released the sixth iteration of [PyEI](https://github.com/mggg/ecological-inference), a Python library 
that consolidates different ER and EI models into a 
single package. We built PyEI because Python, especially with PyMC, is a programming language well suited to do the hard part of EI (namely, MCMC 
runs to learn good coefficients for the probability distributions) in a transparent way that parallelizes nicely. PyEI consolidates many different 
methods into one open-source Python library. 

PyEI has lots of QA checks and convergence heuristics built in, and produces visuals that emphasize both the estimate and the uncertainty.
