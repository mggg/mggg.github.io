This case consolidated a number of different ones that had been active since 2021.  The initial post-Census districting plan was challenged, but before that decision was reached, the State replaced the plan with a new and more aggressively partisan alternative.  A preliminary injunction hearing in October 2025 resulted in a federal court blocking the new plan as a racial gerrymander that was likely to be unconstitutional, not just a now-permissible partisan gerrymander.  SCOTUS stepped in and stayed the injunction.  This report (Duchin's 5th in this case) delineates race-vs.-party distinctions.
