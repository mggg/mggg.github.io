We propose a new family of metrics called capy (or clustering propensity) scores, designed to measure the clustering level of one or more subgroups within a population. The intended application is to offer new ways of measuring the segregation of demographic subgroups. We discuss two main capy scores, Edge and HalfEdge (as well as weighted variants of each) and we compare them to existing segregation scores in the political science, geography, and network science literature. To evaluate the scores, we compute and plot values of minority proportion ρ vs. clustering score C for test distributions on large n × n grids, and on actual demographic data from U.S. states and cities. We argue that capy scores successfully discern qualitatively important differences while providing a stabler baseline for interpretation than classic scores like the Dissimilarity Index and Moran’s I.
