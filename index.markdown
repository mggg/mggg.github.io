# Our Mission

The **MGGG Redistricting Lab** is a research group at Tisch College of Tufts University that grew out of an informal research collective called the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group.  The Lab is led by PI Moon Duchin.  Our staff has expertise and interests spanning mathematics (geometry, topology, discrete math, dynamics), algorithms, software development, geography, [STS](as.tufts.edu/sts/), and policy. We research data science interventions for civil rights.

Our goals are these:

- to pursue cutting-edge **research** in the basic science and practically
  relevant applications of geometry, topology, and computing to the
  redistricting problem;
- to build open-source **tools and resources** that create public access and
  analytical power for better understanding districts and their consequences;
- to partner with **civil rights** organizations to reexamine and strengthen the
  quantitative toolkit for protecting voting rights;
- to offer formal and informal expert **consulting** to stakeholders on all
  sides.
