# Mission

The Data and Democracy Lab pursues cutting-edge research at the intersection of computation and democratic representation. We research data science interventions – better mechanisms, better models, better metrics – for democracy.

## What we do:

**Conduct Research:** We conduct research and develop computational methods to evaluate and inform democratic design, from redistricting algorithms to statistical models of voter preference.

**Build Open Tools & Resources:** We develop and maintain civic technology that democratizes access to powerful analytical methods to understand election systems and their consequences.


**Partner with Civil Rights Organizations:** We partner with groups to re-examine and strengthen the quantitative toolkit for protecting voting rights.

**Work with Community Partners:** We work with community organizations to study how election systems interact with local conditions.
