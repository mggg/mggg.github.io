The MGGG Redistricting Lab is a research organization based at Tufts University studying
applications of geometry and computing to U.S. redistricting. Our mission is both technical
and civic, and we aim to drive cutting-edge research, amplify the voices of the public and the civil
rights community, and improve accountability in the redistricting process.

As of November 2021, we are currently looking for a **[Full Stack Web Developer](#web-developer)**
for a medium-term (3-4 months) full-time position. The Lab is based on the Tufts campus in
Medford/Somerville, MA, but fully remote work is a possibility.
Letters of interest are being accepted
by email to [jobs@mggg.org](mailto:jobs@mggg.org). Please include a CV/résumé with
links to relevant projects, with your GitHub username if applicable. 

Access to voting rights for communities of color and other marginalized groups
is central to our mission, and we strive to build a team that is diverse in as
many ways as possible.
