VoteKit is our "Swiss army knife for computational social choice research." This Python package provides an end-to-end pipeline for reading in ballot data, running ballots through a voting rule to get election outcomes, and then visualizing and analyzing the preferences and winners.

It also implements a suite of statistical models for generating realistic ballots given voter preferences. We use this package to compare different electoral systems for communities and advocates.
