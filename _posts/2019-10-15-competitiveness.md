What is a competitive election, anyway?  At first it may sound like an obvious
question, but it turns out to be hard to specify.  Even more subtle is to 
figure out what exactly we might mean by saying that one <i>districting plan</i>
is more competitive than another.

We've got a recent preprint looking closely at the kinds of competitiveness-promoting
language that is being featured in redistricting reform bills around the country.


In this paper, we examine several classes of *competitiveness metrics* 
and then evaluate their potential outcomes across
large ensembles of districting plans at the Congressional and state Senate
levels. This is part of a growing literature using MCMC techniques from applied
statistics to situate plans and criteria in the context of valid redistricting
alternatives. Our empirical analysis focuses on five states--Utah, Georgia,
Wisconsin, Virginia, and Massachusetts--chosen to represent a range of partisan
attributes. We study the feasibility and the partisan consequences of adopting
and tightening various kinds of competitiveness requirements. We show that
optimizing for competitiveness sometimes pulls partisan metrics to one side of
their neutral baseline. These results highlight the importance of investigating
possible new rules with careful mathematical modeling on real geospatial data
to look for unintended consequences and for tensions with other redistricting
goals.
