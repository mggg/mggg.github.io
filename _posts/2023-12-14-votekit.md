We are proud to announce the release of a new Python package called **[VoteKit](https://github.com/mggg/VoteKit)**, nicknamed "a Swiss army knife for social choice research."

Probably the quickest way to dive in is to check out our tutorial notebooks, which should give a self-contained way to get to know the codebase.
* [Notebook 1](https://tinyurl.com/VoteKit1) - Intro
* [Notebook 2](https://tinyurl.com/VoteKit2) - Real and Simulated Profiles
* [Notebook 2B](https://tinyurl.com/VoteKit2B) - Visualizations
* [Notebook 3](https://tinyurl.com/VoteKit3) - Election Systems

These were created in Colab, which is a free Google browser-based resource for running Python with standardized installations and no fuss.  To use them, it's best to be logged in to a Google account and then save a copy of the notebook to your drive and use that one to edit and run.

The notebooks above were created with feedback we got from the attendees at a live training session held on November 29, 2023, with breakout rooms led by Chris Donnay, Moon Duchin, Mala Mukundan, and James Turk.
