In partnership with New America, we have applied a suite of statistical models to test alternative electoral systems for the Massachusetts state legislature, varying styles of voter behavior and other features of the electoral
context.

Our modeling varies voter preferences both by racial/ethnic group and along partisan
lines. We present extensive results for single transferable vote (STV), a style of ranked choice voting
in multi-member districts. Broadly, we find that STV is likely to secure representation that is in line
with support proportionality, or the share of voters who support each slate of candidates.
