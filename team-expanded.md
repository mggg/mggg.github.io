<!-- As an organization, MGGG operates on multiple scales. We have a core group in the Boston area, a larger group of active contributors working with us on various projects, and several hundred people who attended our cycle of training sessions around the country in 2017-18, including dozens who are preparing to serve as expert witnesses and consultants.

At the largest level of zoom, 1,932 people from a range of specialized backgrounds had filled out our [Skills and Interests Inventory](https://goo.gl/forms/kHmDliQ9o7BMxx6W2) as of Oct 1, 2018 to be part of our global network of collaborators on call. This represents a very wide range of talent, from statistics to critical race theory to mobile app development. If your organization needs technical expertise in the voting rights sphere, please reach out to us for contacts and support at [gerrymandr@gmail](mailto:gerrymandr@gmail.com). -->
