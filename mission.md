# Mission

The Data and Democracy Lab pursues cutting-edge research at the intersection of computation and democratic representation. We research data science interventions – better mechanisms, better models, better metrics – for democracy.

## What we do:

**Research:** We conduct research and develop computational methods to evaluate and inform democratic design, from redistricting algorithms to statistical models of ranked choice voting.

**Build Open Tools & Resources:** We develop open-source software that democratizes access to powerful analytical methods to understand election systems and their consequences.

**Partner with Civil Rights Organizations** to re-examine and strengthen the quantitative toolkit for protecting voting rights.

**Work with Community Partners:** We work with community partners to help them understand what system of election meets their local needs.
