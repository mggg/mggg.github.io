How the Lab has used the power of computational redistricting to analyze enacted, proposed, and challenged legislative maps.

## Reports
- [Comparison of Districting Plans for the Virginia House of Delegates:](/publications/VA-report.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} The Lab's very first redistricting report. This report presents a large ensemble of alternative valid districting plans, which we propose
to use as a baseline for comparison in the evaluation of the (then) newly proposed plans for the VA legislature. Our method
highlights and quantifies the dilutive effects of packing Black Voting Age Population.
- [Outlier analysis for Pennsylvania:](/publications/md-report.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} Moon's very first expert witness report for the 2010 cycle PA maps, showing that the Pennsylvania redistricting plan submitted by Speaker Turzai and President Pro Tem Scarnati is an
extreme outlier among redistricting plans.
- [The Mathematicians' Brief in Rucho v. Common Cause:](/amicus) The Lab organized a collaborative effort of mathematical and legal experts to file an amicus brief for the upcoming Supreme Court gerrymandering cases. An amicus brief is a "friend of the court" filing, where outside parties try to help supply the court with useful information.
- [Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission Post-Mortem:](/publications/MICRC-Report.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} In the redistricting cycle following the 2020 Decennial Census, the state of Michigan overhauled
its redistricting process by passing control to a newly formed body: the MICRC, or Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission. This report, undertaken in cooperation between Voters Not Politicians and the MGGG Redistricting Lab at Tufts University, will offer material for a critical look at areas of commission design and procedure.
- [Privacy, Census Data, and Arizona Redistricting:](/publications/AZ-DP.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} A presentation given to show how the use of differential privacy in the Census would not impact the ability to enforce the VRA or uphold traditional redistricting principles.
- [UK Boundaries:](/publications/UK_Boundaries.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} The Lab was approached by the UK Boundary Commission, their body resposible for redistricting, to help them understand some of the tradeoffs made by prioritizing the preservation of particular municipal boundaries in redistricting England.
