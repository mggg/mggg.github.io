We are excited to share our first cohort of Structural Democracy Fellows. These 16 researchers from 
universities around the U.S. and the world are funded to build and strengthen a research community in Structural Democracy,
which is meant to include a range of practically applicable areas in the study of systems of election.
Topics include (computational) social choice, mechanism design, computational redistricting, statisti-
cal models of elections, data visualization for elections, behavioral psychology of ranking and voting,
dynamics of turnout and engagement, and the design of law and policy around voting.

The fellows have proposed the following topics for study:

## Spanning Tree Methods for Sampling Balanced Partitions
### PI: Kristopher Tapp, St. Joseph's University

Modern redistricting algorithms obtain balanced partitions of graphs by splitting random spanning trees.  This approach leads to several important mathematical questions whose resolutions could help improve the algorithms and more precisely characterize their output.  For example, I propose to study the probability that a (UST or MST) random spanning tree of an n-by-n grid can be split.  Additionally, I propose an improvement of the popular SMC algorithm that recursively divides regions in half, rather than repeatedly biting off single districts.
