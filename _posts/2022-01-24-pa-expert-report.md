In this split-control state, the Republican legislature put forward a congressional plan (lightly adapted from a citizen-drawn plan!) and the Democratic governor vetoed it.  This led to a hearing in which many plaintiffs' groups presented maps for consideration.  The basis for decision was the "Free and Equal Elections" clause in the state constitution, which meant that most experts focused on the partisan fairness of the plans.  The state supreme court ultimately adopted a plan proposed by one of the plaintiff groups.  This [report](/publications/expert_reports/PA-Jan24-2022.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} focuses on how to understand partisan properties of a plan.

Status: State court, decided 2022.
