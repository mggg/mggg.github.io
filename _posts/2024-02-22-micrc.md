In the redistricting cycle following the 2020 Decennial Census, the state of Michigan overhauled
its redistricting process by passing control to a newly formed body: the MICRC, or Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission. [This report](/publications/MICRC-Report.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, undertaken in cooperation between Voters Not Politicians and the MGGG Redistricting Lab at Tufts University, will offer material for a critical look at areas of commission design and procedure.
