We consider several possible remedies for the exclusion of candidates of choice
for minority voters in Yakima's county commission, including several ways to draw majority-minority districts in a 3-district system. We find that ranked choice voting, rather than the
use of majority-minority districts, is likely to provide the most effective and long-lasting
opportunity for Hispanic and Native voters to elect their candidates of choice.
