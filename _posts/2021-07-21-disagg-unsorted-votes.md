Some modes of voting, including absentee and early voting, are only reported at
the county level. We call these votes unsorted as they have not been sorted into respective precincts. In [this report](/publications/Disagg.pdf) we compare several different methods
for county-to-precinct vote disaggregation and discuss various methodological considerations for practitioners.
