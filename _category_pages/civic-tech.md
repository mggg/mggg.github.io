## Tools for Democratic Participation
Democracy works best when everyone can participate in shaping it. This section brings together the software, data, code, and interactive tools the Lab has built and collected to democratize access to sophisticated methods for redistricting and electoral analysis.

All our tools are **open-source and freely available.** We believe the methods for analyzing democracy should be democratic themselves: transparent, accessible, and community-owned. Whether you're a community member who wants to draw your own district map, a researcher analyzing voting patterns, a journalist covering redistricting, or an advocate building a voting rights case, these tools put computational methods in your hands.
